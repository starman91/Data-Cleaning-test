# Getting and Cleaning Data Test

### Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is to explore the concepts of taking exisiting data from the wild and creating tidy data from those products. This script will take the UCI HAR Data sets, realting to wearable physical monitoring (exercise) devices and computer averages from the device telemetry. The analysis is perfomed in several steps that will combine then extract data from several files.

### Purpose
A full description is available at the site where the data is obtained:

Here are the data:

### Process 

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
